    print("\n❌ PREVIOUS ISSUES:")
    print("   • Fire extinguisher detection good, but other equipment poor")
    print("   • Low confidence scores for non-fire-extinguisher items")
    print("   • Missing detections for FirstAidBox, SafetySwitchPanel")
    print("   • Inconsistent performance across different equipment types")
    
    print("\n✅ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:")
    print("   1. Class-Specific Confidence Thresholds:")
    print("      • OxygenTank: 35% threshold (was 25%)")
    print("      • NitrogenTank: 35% threshold")

    print("   1. Upload fire extinguisher → Should still work excellently")
    print("   2. Upload nitrogen/oxygen tanks → Better detection now")
    print("   3. Upload safety panels/switches → Much improved detection")
    print("   4. Upload emergency phones → Enhanced confidence scores")
